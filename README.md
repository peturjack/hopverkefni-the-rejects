Group Project - Module 4

We have designed a mobile-first website that allows users to conveniently schedule walk-in appointments at their preferred local health clinic. No longer will patients have to physically visit the clinic and wait in the crowded waiting room. With our website, users can join the line at their clinic, and they can do that from any location with internet access, providing flexibility and convenience for the user. 
As the appointment time approaches, users will receive text message reminders, allowing them to head to the clinic. 
This approach reduces the time spent in proximity to other patients,  benefiting both patients and health care workers.
