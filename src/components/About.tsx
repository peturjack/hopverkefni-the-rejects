            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>With our user-friendly platform, you can request a ticket for your doctor's appointment right from your living room.
            <br /> 
            No need to arrive early or wait in line. Just take your ticket, and you're all set.
            When your appointment is due you'll get a notification that it's time to head to the clinic.<br />
            Instead of sitting in a room full of sick individuals, you can wait in a designated area—safe, socially distanced, and stress-free.</p>
